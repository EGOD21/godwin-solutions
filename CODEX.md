# Godwin Solutions LLC Updates

## Overview
- Implemented client-requested branding updates across the landing page for Godwin Solutions LLC.
- Integrated the provided transparent logo asset using `next/image` and refreshed hero messaging.
- Adjusted metadata and package description to reflect the LLC naming.

## Key Changes
- `app/page.tsx`: introduced a `COMPANY_NAME` constant, swapped the hero badge for the supplied logo, updated copy for The Godwin Group, and added accessibility tweaks to link buttons.
- `app/layout.tsx`: updated the global metadata title and description with the LLC branding.
- `public/godwin-solutions-logo.png`: stored the supplied logo asset in the public directory for optimized delivery.
- `package.json`: aligned the project description with the new branding language.

## Outstanding Items
- `npm run lint` currently fails because dependencies are not installed in this environment (`next` command missing). Install packages before linting locally or in CI.

## Recommendations & Notes
- For the cards, maintain cohesive imagery (brand abstract graphics or curated screenshots) to keep the grid consistent; avoid snapshotting full web pages unless styled uniformly.
- Consider adding a lightweight “Services at a glance” band or stat strip beneath the grid to expand the LLC narrative.
